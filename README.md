# Hello, I am Ishant 👋

This repo is meant for all my small java projects and practice files. 

## Projects Overview 

These are the projects in this repository so far: 

1. [Console App](Console%20App) - This is a sample library system, which I used to understand object-oriented programming.

## Practice Exercises

The other files are practice files I used to first understand Java. [Main](/Main.java) is the main file which contains all my beginner code.
